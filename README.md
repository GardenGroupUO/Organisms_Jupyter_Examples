This repository is designed to provide examples of how to use the Organisms program. The Organisms program is designed to perform a genetic algorithm global optimisation for nanoclusters. It has been designed with inspiration from the Birmingham Cluster Genetic Algorithm and the Birmingham Parallel Genetic Algorithm from the Roy Johnston Group. 

See the documentation for the Organisms program online at [organisms.readthedocs.io/en/latest/](https://organisms.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). See the documentation about how to install Organisms, including how to install it through PIP. 

The github page for the Organisms program is found at [github.com/GardenGroupUO/Organisms](https://github.com/GardenGroupUO/Organisms)

To Run this repository through Binder, press the Binder button below.

This will load a Binder page that will allow you to play about with the Organisms program interactively in Binder. This will take about 1 to 2 minutes to load. Don't refresh the page as Binder takes a good amount of time to load. Get a coffee or a cup of tea while you wait. Once this is done you will see a Jupyter notebook that you can interact with. Mess around with it as much as you want!

Have fun!
