Therefore it has a first nearest neighbour of 2.884 Å and a second nearest neighbour of 4.078 Å. Therefore r_ij should be set to some value between 2.884 Å and 4.078 Å. For example, r_ij = 3.5 Å or r_ij = 4.0 Å would probably be appropriate, however I have been able to get away with r_ij = 3.0 Å.\n",

Don’t make this too big, or else it is likely atoms will be too far apart and a cluster will be broken into multiple pieces.\n",

    "* **force_replace_pop_clusters_with_offspring** (*bool*): In the genetic algorithm, the predation operator may find that the an offspring is “identical” to a cluster in the population, but that offspring is more fit than the cluster in the population. In this case, the genetic algorithm can replace the less fit cluster in the population with the “identical” more fit offspring. Set this variable to ``True`` if you want this to happen. Set this variable to ``False`` if you don’t want this to happen. Default: ``True``.\n",
    "* **user_initilised_population_folder** (*str.*): This is the name, or the path to, the folder holding the initalised population that you would like to use instead of the program creating a set of randomly generated clusters. If you do not have, or do not want to use, an initialised population, set this to ``None`` or ``''``.\n",

    "* **print_details** (*bool*): Will print the details of the genetic algotithm, like a verbose.\n",
    "* **no_of_cpus** (*int*): This is the number of cpus that you would like the algorithm to run on. These extra cores will be used to create the offspring as well as used by the predation and fitness operators if beneficial to use extra cores for the chosen operators.\n",
    "* **finish_algorithm_if_found_cluster_energy** (*dict.*): This parameter will stop the algorithm if the desired global minimum is found. This parameter is to be used if the user would like to test the performance of the algorithm and knows beforehand what the energy of the global minimum is. This parameter is set as a dictionary as two parameters. ‘cluster energy’ is a float that states the energy of the global minimum. ‘round’ is an interger that you want to set to the same rounding that you gave for the ‘cluster energy’ input. This will round the energy of clusters made, and compare this energy to your ‘cluster energy’ input. An example of this for Au38 using Cleri Gupta parameters are ``finish_algorithm_if_found_cluster_energy = {'cluster energy': -130.54, 'round': 2}``. If you are not testing the performance of the algorithm, or dont know the global minimum of the cluster you are testing, set ``finish_algorithm_if_found_cluster_energy = None``. Default: ``None``\n",
    "* **total_length_of_running_time** (*int*): This is the maximum amount of time (in hours) that the algorithm is allow to run for. This variable is useful if you are running on a remote computer system like slurm that finishes once a certain time limit is reached. To prevent the algorithm from being incorrectly cancelled when running, set this value to a time limit less than your maximum time limit on slurm. I have been setting this to the slurm job time minus 2 hours. For example, if the genetic algorithm is submitted to slurm for 72 hours, set ``total_length_of_running_time=70.0``. While this algorithm is designed to be able to be restarted even if the program is cancelled during a generation, it is best to prevent any issues from occurring by using this variable to cancel the algorithm safety so that there are absolutely no issues when restarting the genetic algorithm.
