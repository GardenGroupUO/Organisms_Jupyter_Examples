In this example, we will perform a genetic algorithm with a simple energy predation operator, the energy fitness operator, and a population-based epoch method. We will go through step by step all the components of the *Run.py* files required to run Organisms on Au<sub>38</sub>. See [organisms.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Using_Run](https://organisms.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Using_Run.html) for more information on the *Run.py* file.\n",
